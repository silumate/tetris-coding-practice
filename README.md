# tetris-coding-practice
Simple implementation of Tetris using HTML, CSS, JS.  Why? For the learning experience.

I am following the *Free Code Camp* course on YouTube: [Code Tetris: JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw) by [kubowania](https://github.com/kubowania).
The code from the course is [here](https://github.com/kubowania/Tetris-Basic) (but don't cheat).
